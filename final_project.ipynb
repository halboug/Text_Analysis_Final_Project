        "#Voices of the Salman Doctrine: Textual Analysis of Saudi Leadership Rhetoric\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##Introduction and Context\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>Since the death of King Abdullah and the subsequent rise of what is being called the “Salman Doctrine” in Saudi Arabia, the nation has seen tremendous shifts in policies. Additionally, with the ascension of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, otherwise known as MBS, these shifts gained further momentum. The sweeping changes spanned a broad spectrum, from social reforms to foreign policy.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>During the same period, the government has been touting its achievements and promising more structural reforms officials have been more vocal and participated in media events including panels, speeches, and interviews. But it is difficult to discern which of these reforms are actually being implemented and producing real results. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>One way to analyze if the government is producing results is testing the priorities that appear in their rhetoric against global indices and major policies. Analyzing the content of Saudi leadership’s media appearances offers a potential way to uncover key policy issues/trends that appear in Saudi leadership's rhetoric. Understanding the new direction not only provides a clearer picture of the kingdom's current trajectory but also helps understand the progress the country has been making in recent years or lack thereof. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "##The Hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>The hypothesis is that by analyzing the content of media appearances, speeches, and interviews of the new Saudi leadership since the rise of MBS, we can identify specific policy issues and trends that have become central to the 'Salman Doctrine', then by comparing them to global indices, we can identify progress in each area. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "##Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "###Data collection:\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>For the methodology, the YouTube API was utilized to extract transcripts of media appearances for Saudi leadership. This can include panel participation, interviews, and speeches. The selection criteria for the leadership would be ministerial-level or similar positions that frequently participate in media events. After processing that text and cleaning the data, we move onto the next phase. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "###Data Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>The primary analytical method would be topic modeling. Topic modeling would help break down the vast amounts of text into distinct clusters. This would give insights into the topics and policies that are more frequent in the rhetoric and, by inference, into the direction and focus of the government. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "###Evaluation:\n",
        "<p>After identifying the top policy themes present in the transcripts, they are evaluated against the respective global indices. Progress will be measured in comparison to other countries depending on context. Major policy changes will also be considered where relevant. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "##Challenges and limitations\n",
        "<p>However, there are also limitations and challenges. First, it is important to acknowledge that this would not give a comprehensive evaluation of the Saudi government, but more a piece of the puzzle. Second, media appearances structured as an interview or a panel, the interviewer or other participants’ speech might influence the results. Additionally, the focus would be in appearances conducted in English as Arabic is usually reserved for internal appearances. English is used by Saudi leaders to present themselves to the world. But even in that case, the use of Arabic proper nouns or terms within English transcripts might pose challenges, potentially leading to misinterpretations or inaccuracies during analysis. </p>\n",

        "From the results of the topic modeling, initially it seems that it is difficult to decipher the desired policy requirements. I went back and added more words I want to be removed from the text. Now the list generated seems a little more coherent. In addition, context definitely matters in this case as the model does not understand what I want (to be fair I usually don’t understand what I want). There also seems to be some overlap between the topics [(Kessel, 2019)](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/interpreting-and-validating-topic-models-ff8f67e07a32).  \n",

        "When taken the context into account, we can identify some common words that indicate a policy direction. So unfortunately, we have to alleviate this challenge with manual brain power. For example (people, opportunity, development, women) would indicate something along the lines of women’s rights and/or social development .\n",

        "1.   Energy and Environment: managing its key oil and gas sector while embracing renewable energy and sustainability. This highlights the kingdom's effort to balance being a major energy producer with evolving global environmental trends.\n",
        "2.   Women’s Rights and Social Development: This includes advancing women's rights and broader social reforms, emphasizing gender equality, and aligning social policies with international standards.\n",

It is important to note that using this approach does not give the full picture. Context can influence these indices. For example, the 2020 pandemic did affect the Human Development Index (HDI) worldwide. This was taken into account in the evaluation, but other pieces of information might be missing that give context to the progress of the policies. </p>\n",

        "#### 1- Energy and Environment: Decline\n",
        "Using the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), the data from 2016 places Saudi Arabia’s ranking at 95 out of 180 countries. The latest report as of 2022, places the country at 109 out of 180. This means the country actually fell down 14 spots [(EPI)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/epi/sets/browse).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the ACEEE International Energy Efficiency Scorecard, Saudi Arabia scored 10 points out of a possible 60 and ranked last in the set of countries. The methodology changed for the index in 2022 but the score was 25 out of 100. A notable increase but still the country ranked 23 out of 25 [(ACEE)](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/2022_International_Scorecard/Saudi%20Arabia%20One-Pager.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "####2- Women’s Rights and Social Development: Relative Improvement\n",
        "Using the Human Development Index (HDI), which includes gender disparity and inequality, we see very little growth. The 2016 value of 0.864 and a 2021 value of 0.875. But it is worth mentioning that the world average in 2021 is 0.732 [(UNDP)](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI).  \n",
        "In addition, the HDI plateaued for a significant number of countries during the same period. Also, notable that in 2018, the Saudi government lifted a ban on women driving. Which seems notable. This was a significant milestone for the traditionally conservative country [(NYT, 2019)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/world/middleeast/saudi-driving-ban-anniversary.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "####3- International Cooperation and Regional Stability: Significant Improvement\n",
        "According to the Global Peace Index, Saudi Arabia made the biggest leap in 2022 out of all countries. The country jumped 8 positions in the ranking. While it still ranked 119 out of 163 countries, this marks a significant improvement [(GPI)](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/5-countries-that-recorded-largest-improvements-in-peace-in-2022/).\n",
        "\n",
        "##Conclusion\n",
        "<p>In conclusion, the topic modeling results, enhanced by careful word selection and context consideration, reveal key policy directions for Saudi Arabia's new leadership. The top three identified priorities are Energy and Environment, Women's Rights and Social Development, and International Cooperation and Regional Stability. An evaluation of progress since the leadership transition in 2016 using relevant indices shows mixed results: a decline in Energy and Environment, relative improvement in Women's Rights and Social Development, and significant advancement in International Cooperation and Regional Stability. This analysis underscores the kingdom's ongoing efforts and challenges in these critical areas. </p>"
